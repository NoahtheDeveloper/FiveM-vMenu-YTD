> # vMenu-YTD
> This is the YTD you can use to replace your banner on your vMenu! vMenu was not made by me and I only am posting this to help people when it comes to adding something custom to their server!

> > ► How to setup and configure? ◄
> - You will need the program (OPENIV)
> - With OPENIV you will need to locate the colored menu in this YTD
> - Then you want to customize it yourself
> - Lastly you need to put it in a stream folder with a resource.lua outside of the stream folder and start up your server with the ytd started!
